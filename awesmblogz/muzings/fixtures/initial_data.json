It had happened maybe five times in my life.\n\nBut that year, one cold spring day, when I had the whole beach to myself, I was out for a run, and I found one! A few minutes later, I found another! 30 seconds later, another, and another. I carried them in my pocket at first, but then had to take off my shirt to use it as a bag.\n\nBy the time I got home, I had collected 232 unbroken sand dollar shells.\n\nI put them all out in the sun to dry, amazed at my good luck.\n\nI bragged to my family. This had to put me in our beach-house history book.\n\nI tried to think of all the things I could do with 232 sand dollars.\n\nAfter two days, the excitement wore off. I realized I wasn't ever going to do anything with them. Now it was just stupid for me to keep all of these sand dollars sitting there doing nothing.\n\nThe excitement was in finding them, not keeping them.\n\nThat weekend was a big 3-day holiday weekend, and the beach was going to be filled with tourists.\n\nSo Saturday morning at 6am, I took all 232 sand dollars, and went for a long 10-mile run on the beach, tossing them one at a time, very spaced out, so all the tourist kids could each find a few.\n\nBy the end of my run, as I was heading home, I got the quiet satisfaction of watching two kids scream with excitement at finding one.\n\nHonestly, I had forgotten this story, but my friend Ben told it to my wife last time I saw him, saying he thought it was the one story that summed up who I am.\n\nHe made me promise to post it here.", "date_created": "2011-11-15T06:32:00Z", "slug": "232-sand-dollars"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "muzings.entry", "fields": {"status": 0, "title": "Procrastination Hack : change and to or", "date_updated": "2011-11-10T08:15:37Z", "content": "Source: http://sivers.org/andor\n\n\u201cWhen do you go running?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the time is right.\u201d\n\u201cWhen is the time right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it's a nice day, and I've finished my work, and I haven't just eaten, and I'm feeling energetic.\u201d\n\u201cRepeat that last sentence, changing \u2018and\u2019 to \u2018or\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it's a nice day, OR I've finished my work, OR I haven't just eaten, OR I'm feeling energetic.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like a better plan.\u201d\n\nGot a list of conditions you need satisfied before you do something?\n\nTry changing and to or.", "date_created": "2011-10-24T05:58:24Z", "slug": "procrastination-hack-change-and-to-or"}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "muzings.entry", "fields": {"status": 2, "title": "Fish don't know they're in water", "date_updated": "2011-07-09T12:22:05Z", "content": "Source: http://sivers.org/fish\n\nFish don't know they're in water.\n\nIf you tried to explain it, they'd say, \u201cWater?

I asked, \u201cHow many people would like to start their own company some day?\u201d In a room of 50 people, only one hand (reluctantly) went up.\n\nIf I would have asked this question to a room of 50 business school students in California, 51 hands would have gone up. (Someone would have run in from the hallway just to raise their hand.)\n\nThinking maybe they were just shy, I asked, \u201cReally!? Why not?\u201d - and asked individuals. Their answers:\n\n\u201cWhy take the risk? I just want security.\u201d\n\u201cI spent all this money on school, and need to make it back.\u201d\n\u201cIf I fail, it would be a huge embarassment to my family.\u201d\nThen I realized my local American culture. The land of entrepreneurs and over-confidence. I had heard this before, but I hadn't really felt it until I could see it from a distance.\n\nAll of my Singaporean friends live with their parents. Even pretty successful ones, even married ones, even up to age 35, live with their parents at their parents' home.\n\nWhen I told one that I left home at 17, she was horrified. She said, \u201cIsn't that horribly insulting to your parents? Weren't they devastated?\u201d\n\nThen I realized my local American culture again. The emphasis on individualism, rebellion, following your dreams. I had heard this before, but I hadn't really felt it until I could see it from a distance.\n\nMy culture isn't in the center. It's off on the edge, like one petal in a flower, like they all are. Not right or wrong - just one of many options.\n\nYes, the rest of the world can enjoy a good laugh at the stereotypical American - just now realizing he's not the center of the universe.\n\nI'm just a fish who didn't know he was in water.\n\n\nUPDATE: A few people have linked me to this David Foster Wallace speech.

But my pitch was bad, my tone was bad, and everyone said I was just not a singer.\r\n\r\nAt 17, I started taking voice lessons, and practicing two hours every night. I'd go into a soundproof room for two hours of long-tones, scales, arpeggios, and practicing specific song phrases over and over.\r\n\r\nAt 18, I started touring, doing two to four shows a week, always as the lead singer. Often they were outdoor shows, sometimes with no PA system at all, so I really had to learn how to project to be heard.\r\n\r\nAt 19, I was still practicing two hours a night, but still having a problem with pitch. People kept telling me I was just not a singer - that I should give it up, and find a real singer.\r\n\r\nThen I heard Warren Senders giving a demonstration of Indian vocal music, and his pitch was so perfect, I went rushing up to him afterwards to ask how he did it.\r\n\r\nI said, \u201cHow are you able to hit the notes so perfectly dead-on? Are you just natually good at this?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said, \u201cNo! When I first started singing, not only was I not within an inch of the note - I wasn't within a football field of the note! I was horrible!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo how did you do it?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe jabbed a finger in my chest, and looked me in the eye. \u201cPractice. Thousands of hours of practice, and eventually I got it. I can show you how.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the next year, I'd take a bus out to his place every Wednesday night as he'd teach me some esoteric ways of thinking about singing. (I mentioned them in a previous article, here.)\r\n\r\nI continued touring for years, always as the lead singer. Still taking voice lessons with different teachers in different cities. Still practicing tone, scales and trouble spots for an hour every night.\r\n\r\nAt 25, I recorded my first album. When I gave it to someone who was a real mentor to me, he gave it a focused listen, then said, \u201cDerek, you're just not a singer. You really need to stop trying. Admit you're a songwriter, and find a real singer.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I bounced away from that meeting unfazed. I knew I just had more work to do.\r\n\r\nI toured for three more years after that, always pushing, always practicing, always determined to be a great singer.\r\n\r\nAt 28, I started noticing that my voice was getting good! I recorded a few new songs, and for the first time, I really really liked the vocals!\r\n\r\nAt 29, I had done it. After 15 years of practice, and about 1000 live shows, I was finally a very good singer, at least by my own standards. (You can judge for yourself at sivers.org/music. Old stuff at the bottom. New stuff at the top.)\r\n\r\nSomeone who heard me for the first time then said, \u201cSinging is a gift you're either born with or you're not. You're lucky. You were born with it!\u201d\r\n\r\nI had to remember this story now because I'm spending most of my time doing things I'm not good at. It's overwhelming, sometimes.\r\n\r\nI'm really trying to be a great computer programmer, and so in awe of the people who seem to do it naturally.

I didn't grow up in Hollywood. None of my friends were successful. Success was a secret insider's group to which I'd never belong. I'm just an introvert from Nowhere, Illinois.\n\nSo when I heard, \u201cIt's all who you know,\"\" it felt like the rest of that sentence was, \u201cand you don't know anyone. So forget it.\u201d\n\nOne day in college we had a guest speaker who was a head-honcho at BMI.\n\nOn his way into class I overheard him say he was hungry. He had come straight to our school without lunch, so when the teacher told him it was a two-hour class, he groaned.\n\nBecause everyone was still getting seated, I quickly ran out to the hall, called the local pizza shop, and ordered a few pizzas to be sent to our classroom.\n\nAfter they arrived, he laughed and said, \u201cGood move. I owe you one,\u201d and gave me his card after class, suggesting I keep in touch.\n\nFor the next two years, he always took my calls, gave me all kinds of advice about the music business, and when I graduated college, he got me a great job at Warner Music in New York City. (More specifically: he heard they had an opening and called them to say their search was over, that he knew the best guy for the job, could vouch for me, then gave them my number. They called me to say I was hired already and I started the next day.)\n\nA year later, I realized \u201cIt's all who you know,\u201d doesn't have to be depressing. I just never considered it could work in my favor.\n\nThen once you realize that, you realize the profound conclusion: everything that seems depressing can be flipped to work in your favor.\n\nEvery deal that's bad for someone is good for someone else. So instead of moaning about one end of it, take the other end.\n\nThink banks have an unfair advantage? Then be a bank.\n\nThink corporate radio is keeping your music from being heard? Then make a radio station.\n\nIn 1996, distribution for musicians sucked. The only way to get your music sold was to somehow be that 1-in-1000 that signs a deal with a major distributor, who would keep 60% of the net, which was 50% of the gross, and you were left with $1.50 per CD sold, although they were notorious for never paying, and of course you never found out who bought your music, and they would kick you out if you didn't sell huge numbers in the first few months. So instead of moaning, I just became a distributor.\n\nIt's easier than ever for you to replace a broken system, and never feel helpless again.\n\nIf you're offered the shit end of the stick, never forget you can flip the stick around.\n\n(Then clean it, so it's not shitty for anyone else again.)", "date_created": "2010-03-29T06:56:39Z", "slug": "flip-the-stick"}}, {"pk": 6, "model": "muzings.entry", "fields": {"status": 1, "title": "What do you hate not doing?", "date_updated": "2009-09-06T08:43:18Z", "content": "Source: http://sivers.org/hatenot\n\nWe've all asked ourselves, \u201cWhat do I really love?\u201d or \u201cWhat makes me happy?\u201d\n\nI've wrestled when the emotion-based answers conflict with expectations.

I have so many ideas in my head of websites that would make the world a better place if they existed, services that could help people. It's just a matter of taking a thousand hours to type it all out and turn ideas into reality. Any week not programming is a disappoinment to myself and maybe to others.\nI hate not writing.\nThere are so many things I've learned that I think would help other people to know. Things I wish someone had told me sooner. Things that have made my life better, brighter, or wiser. I want to tell everyone these things before I die, in a well-explained way so they're not misunderstood, and easy to pass on to others. And more new ones are added every week. So I have to keep writing to get them all out. Any day I'm not writing, I'm falling further behind in this goal, which I makes me feel worse.\nI hate not biking.\nI love the adrenaline rush of riding my bike. I love knowing it's good for my health, and making my legs and cardiovascular system stronger so I can bike across India soon. I love it so much that when I don't do it for even a few days, I get annoyed. When I see other people biking, and I'm not biking, I get jealous.\nI hate not talking with friends.\nI'm in my own head so much, that I love hearing what my friends are thinking about instead. I love how my friends think.
